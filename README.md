# JewishCalendar

.NET library that can be imported into C# applications, allowing conversion of gregorian dates into hebrew dates and back. Also can be used for calculations of Jahrzeit (for particular gregorian or jewish years), jewish holidays etc.

This code is based on the java solution of Ulrich and David Greve: http://www.david-greve.de/luach-code/jewish-java.html
Many thanks to them!

Before starting development I read different papers of Mr. Prof. Nachum Dershowitz (Tel Aviv University) about the calendrical calculations, which I found very useful: http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nachum/calendar-book/papers/

This project I dedicate to my grandparents Moshe ben Shlomo, Grigory ben Moshe, Khaya bat Nuchim.
