# JewishCalendar

.NET library that can be imported into C# applications, allowing conversion of gregorian dates into hebrew dates and back. Also can be used for calculations of Jahrzeit (for particular gregorian or jewish years), jewish holidays etc.

This code is based on the java solution of Ulrich and David Greve (source code copyright Â© by Ulrich and David Greve (2005)): http://www.david-greve.de/luach-code/jewish-java.html Many thanks to them!

The papers of Mr. Prof. Nachum Dershowitz (Tel Aviv University) about the calendrical calculations also have contributed to the successful development: http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nachum/calendar-book/papers/

The source code is freely usable for non-profit purposes.

This project is lovingly dedicated to the blessed memory of my grandparents Moshe ben Shlomo, Grigory ben Moshe, Khaya bat Nuchim.
