# JewishCalendar

.NET library that can be imported into C# applications, allowing conversion of a gregorian date into a hebrew date and back. Also can be used for calculations of Jahrzeit (for certain gregorian or jewish year), saving time etc.

This code is based on the java solution of Ulrich and David Greve: http://www.david-greve.de/luach-code/jewish-java.html
Many thanks to them!

Before starting development I read different interesting papers of Mr. Prof. Nachum Dershowitz (Tel Aviv University) about the calendrical calculations, which I found very useful: http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~nachum/calendar-book/papers/
